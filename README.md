# TweetPHP
This webapp illustrates the use of bootstrap library as well as php+mysql in the backend.
It functions like twitter where a user can post his tweets and those who follow those tweets can then view those tweets.
Also a suggestions bar appears in the right corner where the user can start following other users.
